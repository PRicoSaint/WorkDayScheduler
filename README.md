## Project Description
Work Day Scheduler is a simple that allows the user to input events per hour time blocks. Hours covered are 9am to 6pm. These can be modified in the code. The default times usually correspond with normal work day. The user clicks in a box and then types in an input. When finished, they will need to click on the floppy for the text to be saved to the local storage. Values can be seen in the console under Application and Local storage. Each key corresponds to time (in 24hr format) and has the corresponding event saved to it. Upon reloading the page, closing and then returning the page, the values for each hour timeblock will be loaded into their respective hours they were orginally savedt to. They may be overwritten or deleted, the new values just need to be resaved to overwrite what is in local storage. 

As the day progresses, the colors of the time blocks will change color. Grey signifies the hour timeblock has passed. Green means the event is in the future. Red references that the event is currently in progress. Functionality of the web app can be seen below.
